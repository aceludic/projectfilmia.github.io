The **gun** is a key signifier; its **denotation** is a weapon, but its **connotation** is of power, danger, and masculinity, referencing the popular spy genre (James Bond). The man's suit **connotes** professionalism and success. The slogan 'Get what you've always wanted' is an **enigma code** – what does the audience want?

The man is presented as the active, powerful protagonist, while the woman is implied to be a passive 'prize' to be won. This reinforces Van Zoonen's idea that media constructs gender roles, often objectifying women for male pleasure.",

By programming a subtitled Danish drama, the BBC served a niche audience and introduced a major new cultural product to the market, which can be seen as a counter-argument to Hesmondhalgh's focus on risk-aversion in the cultural industries. Its success then paved the way for more foreign-language dramas to be acquired."
